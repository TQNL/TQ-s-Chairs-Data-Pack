# TQ-s-Chairs-Data-Pack
Introducing the Chairs Data Pack for Minecraft â€“ an ingenious way to effortlessly add functional chairs to your world. By simply looking straight down at a slab or stair when on top of them, you can transform them into cosy seats, perfect for enhancing interiors, role-playing, and overall immersion. If you want to make the chair permanent, put a sign on the side. Otherwise, the chair gets removed when no player is within 6 blocks of the chair. Multiplayer compatible and right click to sit in it.
